Hear-2-See is a groundbreaking project that transforms images into meaningful sounds, empowering visually impaired individuals to understand their surroundings like never before.

## Overview

Hear-2-See is an innovative assistive technology project designed to empower individuals with visual impairments by providing them with a unique way to comprehend their surroundings through sound. This system employs image recognition technology and audio synthesis to create a seamless connection between what is seen and what is heard.

## How It Works ü§ñ

1. **Image Capture or Upload:** Users can capture images in real-time using their smartphone's camera or upload existing photos from their personal collections.

2. **Real-Time Feedback:** Users receive instant audio feedback, enabling them to navigate their surroundings more effectively, interact with their environment, and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.

3. **AI Learning:** The system continues to learn and adapt to the user's preferences and feedback, enhancing the overall experience over time.

4. **Empowerment:** Hear-2-See is not just a tool; it's a bridge to independence and inclusivity for the visually impaired. It empowers them to make informed decisions, enjoy richer experiences, and engage more fully in their daily lives.

Hear-2-See is breaking down barriers and promoting a world where everyone, regardless of their visual abilities, can experience the world with greater confidence and understanding. Join us on this incredible journey of sensory transformation! üåéüîäüñºÔ∏è
